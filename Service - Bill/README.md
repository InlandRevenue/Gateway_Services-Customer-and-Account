# Bill Service
---
#### Release version 1.0 


## About the service
* This service is an application programming interface (API) that external applications can call in real-time to retrieve information for a particular customer bill item. The response also includes provisional tax method details and history associated to the account to which the bill item belongs.
* The objective of this API is to allow transaction data services (TDS) software providers to query information that was formerly available in the Tax Agent Web Services (TAWS) data feed.

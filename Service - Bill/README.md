# Bill API

This service is an application programming interface (API) that external applications 
can call in real-time to retrieve information for a particular customer bill item. The 
response also includes provisional tax method details and history associated to the 
account to which the bill item belongs. 
 
The objective of this API is to allow transaction data services (TDS) software providers 
to query information that was formerly available in the Tax Agent Web Services 
(TAWS) data feed.

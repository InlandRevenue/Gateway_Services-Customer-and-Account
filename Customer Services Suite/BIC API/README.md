# BIC API 

#### Release version 1.0

## About the BIC API 

The BIC API enables the adding / updating and ceasing of the BIC codes for an identified customerâ€™s account. It is one of eight APIs that together make up the customer services suite.

>**NOTE:** The BIC API is only available to Digital Service Providers who use X.509 Digital Certificate used for Mutual TLS on port 4046 and requires OAuth2 or JWT token.

## BIC API REST Reference and URL endpoints

| Environment | Scheme Authority | Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication |
| --- | --- | :---: |
| Mock (DPS)| `https://customerservices.test.services.ird.govt.nz`| no |
| Production (PROD) | `https://services.ird.govt.nz:4046`| yes |

#### BIC API - `{Scheme Authority}/gateway/bic/{Service}`
| Service | HTTP request types | Description | 
| -- | :--: | -- | 
| bic |  `DELETE` | Ceases an existing BIC code on a customer |
| bic |  `POST` | Adds new or updates existing BIC code to customer  |
| status | `GET` | This web service sends a 200 HTTP response with a message body of "OK". This is preferred over service "ping" functionality as this should *only* be used to validate the service and credential configuration | 

> The `status` service might not be available in the mock or production environment.

### Mock environment authentication
   * Consumers of this mock service must be authenticated.
   * Access delegation/restriction is not emulated, and any authenticated user has access to the test data.
   * Authentication is provided using one of two methods:
     1. OAuth
        * OAuth token issued by the mock OAuth service. Any valid token issued by the mock OAuth service can be used to access this service.
        * Please consult the [mock OAuth service documentation](https://oauth.test.services.ird.govt.nz/) for further details about the authentication process.
        * The OAuth token should be provided in the 'Authorization' request header as follows:
        ```
        Authorization: Bearer {OAuthAccessToken}
        ```
     2. JWT
        * Alternatively a self-issued JWT may be used to access the service.
        * Please consult the build pack for information on the token structure.
        * The mock service does not validate the following JWT attributes:
            * "sub" field
            * "iss" field
            * token signature
        * The JWT should be provided in the 'Authorization' request header as follows (note the 'Bearer' prefix is omitted):
        ```
        Authorization: {JWT}
        ```

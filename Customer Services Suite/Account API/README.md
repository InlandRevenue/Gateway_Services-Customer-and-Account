# Account API 

#### Release version 1.0

## About the Account API 

The account API provides either a list of accounts for an identified customer or information about a single customer account. It is one of seven APIs that together make up the customer services suite. An account represents a tax type (for example income tax) or a product (for example KiwiSaver). 

>**NOTE:** The Account API is only available to Digital Service Providers who use X.509 Digital Certificate used for Mutual TLS on port 4046 and requires OAuth2 or JWT token.

#### Account API - `{Scheme Authority}/gateway/Account/{Service}`
| Service | HTTP request types | Description | 
| :--: | :--: | -- |
| account | `POST` | Returns the information of an identified customer account | 
| list | `POST` | Returns a list of accounts for an identified customer | 
| status | `GET` | This web service sends a 200 HTTP response with a message body of "OK". This is preferred over service "ping" functionality as this should *only* be used to validate the service and credential configuration | 

> The `status` service might not be available in the mock environment.

### Mock environment authentication
* Consumers of this mock service must be authenticated.
* Access delegation/restriction is not emulated, and any authenticated user has access to the test data.
* Authentication is provided using one of two methods:
 1. OAuth
	* OAuth token issued by the mock OAuth service. Any valid token issued by the mock OAuth service can be used to access this service.
	* Please consult the [mock OAuth service documentation](https://mock-oauth.ird.digitalpartner.services/) for further details about the authentication process.
	* The OAuth token should be provided in the 'Authorization' request header as follows:
	```
	Authorization: Bearer {OAuthAccessToken}
	```
 2. JWT
	* Alternatively a self-issued JWT may be used to access the service.
	* Please consult the build pack for information on the token structure.
	* The mock service does not validate the following JWT attributes:
		* "sub" field
		* "iss" field
		* token signature
	* The JWT should be provided in the 'Authorization' request header as follows (note the 'Bearer' prefix is omitted):
	```
	Authorization: {JWT}
	```

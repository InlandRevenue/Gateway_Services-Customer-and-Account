## About the Name API

The name API enables the creating, updating, and deleting of the customerâ€™s names. It is one of seven APIs that together make up the customer services suite. 

>**NOTE:** The Name API is only available to Digital Service Providers who use X.509 Digital Certificate used for Mutual TLS on port 4046 and requires OAuth2 or JWT token.

## Name API REST Reference

| Environment | Scheme Authority | Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication |
| --- | --- | :---: |
| Mock (DPS)| `https://mock-cus.ird.digitalpartner.services`| no |
| Production (PROD) | `https://services.ird.govt.nz:4046`| yes |

#### Name API - `{Scheme Authority}/gateway/name/{Service}`
| Service | HTTP request types | Description | 
| :--: | :--: | -- |
| name | `POST` | Adds a name of a given type (preferred/trading) to the customer data set |
| name | `PUT` | Updates the details of an existing name in the customer data set |
| name | `DELETE` | Deletes a given name from the customer data set |
| status | `GET` | This web service sends a 200 HTTP response with a message body of "OK". This is preferred over service "ping" functionality as this should *only* be used to validate the service and credential configuration | 

> The `status` service might not be available in the mock environemnt.

### Mock environment authentication
* Consumers of this mock service must be authenticated.
* Access delegation/restriction is not emulated, and any authenticated user has access to the test data.
* Authentication is provided using one of two methods:
 1. OAuth
	* OAuth token issued by the mock OAuth service. Any valid token issued by the mock OAuth service can be used to access this service.
	* Please consult the [mock OAuth service documentation](https://mock-oauth.ird.digitalpartner.services/) for further details about the authentication process.
	* The OAuth token should be provided in the 'Authorization' request header as follows:
	```
	Authorization: Bearer {OAuthAccessToken}
	```
 2. JWT
	* Alternatively a self-issued JWT may be used to access the service.
	* Please consult the build pack for information on the token structure.
	* The mock service does not validate the following JWT attributes:
		* "sub" field
		* "iss" field
		* token signature
	* The JWT should be provided in the 'Authorization' request header as follows (note the 'Bearer' prefix is omitted):
	```
	Authorization: {JWT}
	```

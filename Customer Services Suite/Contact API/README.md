### Mock environment authentication
   * Consumers of this mock service must be authenticated.
   * Access delegation/restriction is not emulated, and any authenticated user has access to the test data.
   * Authentication is provided using one of two methods:
     1. OAuth
        * OAuth token issued by the mock OAuth service. Any valid token issued by the mock OAuth service can be used to access this service.
        * Please consult the [mock OAuth service documentation](https://mock-oauth.ird.digitalpartner.services/) for further details about the authentication process.
        * The OAuth token should be provided in the 'Authorization' request header as follows:
        ```
        Authorization: Bearer {OAuthAccessToken}
        ```
     2. JWT
        * Alternatively a self-issued JWT may be used to access the service.
        * Please consult the build pack for information on the token structure.
        * The mock service does not validate the following JWT attributes:
            * "sub" field
            * "iss" field
            * token signature
        * The JWT should be provided in the 'Authorization' request header as follows (note the 'Bearer' prefix is omitted):
        ```
        Authorization: {JWT}
        ```
